\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I thank my supervisor Dr. Juan José Durillo for his guidance and engagement. He encouraged me to develop my own ideas. I also want to thank Simon Haller, Tizian Müller and the other guys at the Institute of Computer Science of Innsbruck for the provision of the test cluster and their helpful suggestions. Furthermore I want to thank my family and friends for their ongoing support. They believed in me and helped me in all situations.
