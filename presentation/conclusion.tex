  Biohadoop is suitable framework to provide Optimization as a Service:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Runs in the cloud
    \item Depends only on Hadoop + YARN
    \item Provides simple API to implement optimization algorithms
    \item Provides correct computation results
    \item Good speedups achievable for parallel algorithms (although speedups depend on problem)
  \end{itemize}
  Open topic: simple interface to interact with Service
