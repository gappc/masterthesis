Problem optimization is a fundamental task encountered everywhere, from everydays life to the most complex science areas. Finding the optimal solution often takes an unreasonable amount of time or computing resources. Therefore, approximation techniques are used to find near-optimal solutions. Bio-inspired algorithms provide such approximation techniques, they mimic existing solutions found in the nature. But even those techniques are sometimes to slow for extensive problems, so they need to be run in parallel.

This master thesis presents a new framework, Biohadoop, to facilitate the implementation of bio-inspired optimization algorithms on top of Apache Hadoop. To demonstrate its usefulness, two implementations of bio-inspired optimization techniques are implemented and their performance 

. The implementations are than used to evaluate the performance characteristics of Biohadoop. Finally, the implementations are made usable by Apache Oozie, which is a Hadoop workflow scheduler that uses XML for its workflow configuration. This way, those optimization techniques are made accessible to a broader range of users.

% In this master-thesis, implementations of some bio-inspired optimization techniques are provided that can be run on an Apache Hadoop cluster, by using the capabilities of YARN. The runtimes of those algorithms are then compared to their sequential version. Finally, the implementations are made usable by Apache Oozie, which is a Hadoop workflow scheduler that uses XML for its workflow configuration. This way, those optimization techniques are made accessible to a broader range of users.
